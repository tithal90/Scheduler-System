# Scheduler-System
A formal framework is proposed for the scheduler of complex real time systems, modeled as client-server scheduling systems, using the popular approach. My implementation and experiments corroborate the feasibility of such an approach are some of the important features in our theory and implementation.   Implementation has been done in Java Programming (Tool: Eclipse).
